<!-- ##TODO## finish updating this -->

This repository is in the process of being upgraded to follow the
[pathogen repo guide][].

## Installation

Follow the [standard installation instructions][] for Nextstrain's
suite of software tools.

## Working on this repo

This repo is configured to use [pre-commit][] to help automatically
catch common coding errors and syntax issues with changes before they
are committed to the repo.

If you will be writing new code or otherwise working within this repo,
please do the following to get started:

1. install `pre-commit` by running either `python -m pip install
   pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`, depending on your
   preferred package management solution
2. install the local git hooks by running `pre-commit install` from
   the root of the repo
3. when problems are detected, correct them in your local working tree
   before committing them.

Note that these pre-commit checks are also run in a GitHub Action when
changes are pushed to GitHub, so correcting issues locally will
prevent extra cycles of correction.
