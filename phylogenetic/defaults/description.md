We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting
laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their
work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared
data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free
license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where
possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances.
Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if
uncertain.

#### Analysis

Our bioinformatic processing workflow can be found at
[github.com/nextstrain/yellow-fever][] and includes:

- sequence alignment by [augur align][]
- phylogenetic reconstruction using [IQTREE-2][]
- ancestral state reconstruction and temporal inference using [TreeTime][]

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as starting point for
our analyses.
